Title: Merging Multiple PDF Files using Django with Error Handling

```python
import os
from PyPDF2 import PdfMerger
from django.http import HttpResponse, JsonResponse
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

# Sample file upload form template
# You need to create a templates directory with a file `upload.html` and include basic file upload form
# Example upload.html content:
# <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
#     {% csrf_token %}
#     <input type="file" name="pdf_files" accept="application/pdf" multiple required>
#     <button type="submit">Merge PDFs</button>
# </form>

@csrf_exempt
def upload_and_merge_pdf(request):
    """View to handle PDF upload and merge."""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        files = request.FILES.getlist('pdf_files')
        
        # Ensure there are files to process
        if not files:
            return JsonResponse({"error": "No PDF files uploaded"}, status=400)

        merger = PdfMerger()
        try:
            # Attempt to append each PDF file to the merger
            for pdf in files:
                if pdf.content_type != 'application/pdf':
                    return JsonResponse({"error": "All files must be PDFs"}, status=400)
                merger.append(pdf)

            # Generate a response with the merged PDF
            response = HttpResponse(content_type='application/pdf')
            response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename="merged.pdf"'
            merger.write(response)  # Write the merged PDF to the response
            return response

        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any exceptions that arise during processing
            return JsonResponse({"error": f"An error occurred while merging PDFs: {str(e)}"}, status=500)

        finally:
            # Clean up merger resources
            merger.close()

    # For GET request or if no files, render the upload page
    return render(request, 'upload.html')
```

### Note:
- Make sure `PyPDF2` is installed in your environment with `pip install PyPDF2`.
- The `upload.html` template should be created inside a `templates` directory in your Django project for rendering the basic file upload form.
- This simple example assumes the Django settings and project files are appropriately configured and focuses on core functionality: merging PDFs with error handling.
