# Title: Text-Based RPG in Django with Modular Design

# In this implementation, we will simulate a simple text-based RPG using Django.
# The project will be divided into several Django apps for modularity.

# Assumptions:
# - The game will have Players, Monsters, and Battles
# - Players can attack monsters and vice versa
# - Players have attributes like health, attack power, etc.

# Step 1: Create a Django project and apps
# In your terminal, run the following commands:
# django-admin startproject rpg_project
# cd rpg_project
# python manage.py startapp players
# python manage.py startapp monsters
# python manage.py startapp battles

# Step 2: Define Models

# players/models.py
from django.db import models

class Player(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    health = models.IntegerField(default=100)
    attack_power = models.IntegerField(default=10)

    def attack(self, monster):
        """Simulate player attacking a monster"""
        monster.health -= self.attack_power
        monster.save()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

# monsters/models.py
from django.db import models

class Monster(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    health = models.IntegerField(default=50)
    attack_power = models.IntegerField(default=5)

    def attack(self, player):
        """Simulate monster attacking a player"""
        player.health -= self.attack_power
        player.save()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

# Step 3: Implement Battle Logic

# battles/models.py
from django.db import models
from players.models import Player
from monsters.models import Monster

class Battle(models.Model):
    player = models.ForeignKey(Player, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    monster = models.ForeignKey(Monster, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    winner = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)

    def start_battle(self):
        """Simulate a battle between player and monster"""
        while self.player.health > 0 and self.monster.health > 0:
            self.player.attack(self.monster)
            if self.monster.health > 0:
                self.monster.attack(self.player)

        if self.player.health > 0:
            self.winner = self.player.name
        else:
            self.winner = self.monster.name
        self.save()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Battle: {self.player.name} vs {self.monster.name}"

# Step 4: Register models in admin for easy testing

# players/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Player

admin.site.register(Player)

# monsters/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Monster

admin.site.register(Monster)

# battles/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Battle

admin.site.register(Battle)

# Step 5: Configure installed apps in settings.py
# Add 'players', 'monsters', 'battles' to INSTALLED_APPS in rpg_project/settings.py

# Step 6: Testing
# - Run migrations: python manage.py makemigrations followed by python manage.py migrate
# - Use Django admin to create players and monsters
# - Simulate battles by creating Battle instances programmatically or in the admin interface

```

This code provides a modular design for a simple text-based RPG using Django, keeping complexity moderate while employing best practices, such as dividing functionalities across different apps.
