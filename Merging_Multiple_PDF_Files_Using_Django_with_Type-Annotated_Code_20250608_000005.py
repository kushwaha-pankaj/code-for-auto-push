Title: Merging Multiple PDF Files Using Django with Type-Annotated Code

```python
import os
from typing import List
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render
from PyPDF2 import PdfReader, PdfWriter

    Display a simple form to upload multiple PDF files.

    for file_path in files:
        pdf_reader = PdfReader(file_path)
        for page in range(len(pdf_reader.pages)):
            pdf_writer.add_page(pdf_reader.pages[page])

    return pdf_writer

        response = HttpResponse(content_type='application/pdf')
        response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename="merged_document.pdf"'
        
        # Write merged PDF to response
        pdf_writer.write(response)
        
        # Clean up temporary files
        for file_name in file_names:
            try:
                os.remove(file_name)
            except OSError:
                pass 

        return response
    else:
        return HttpResponse("Invalid request method.", status=400)
```

Please note that you would need to create a simple HTML form `merge_pdfs.html` for file uploads and ensure that the PyPDF2 library is installed in your environment. This code provides a Django view to handle file uploads, merge PDF files, and return the merged document.
